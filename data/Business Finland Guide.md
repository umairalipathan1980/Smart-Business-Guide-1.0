# Business Guide: How to Set Up Business in Finland

This image appears to be the cover page of a business guide focused on setting up a business in Finland. The document is titled "BUSINESS GUIDE" in large blue text, followed by the subtitle "HOW TO SET UP BUSINESS IN FINLAND" also in blue.

The image features a woman with long dark hair, smiling broadly. She is wearing a patterned blue and gray blouse and appears to be holding a mobile device. The background is blurred but seems to be an outdoor urban setting.

At the bottom of the image, there are two logos:
- BUSINESS FINLAND
- INVEST IN FINLAND

This cover page suggests that the document is an official guide produced by Business Finland and the Invest in Finland initiative to assist entrepreneurs and businesses looking to establish operations in Finland. The cheerful image of the woman conveys a welcoming and positive attitude towards business opportunities in the country.

The combination of the professional design, official logos, and the image of a happy individual creates an inviting first impression for those considering business ventures in Finland.

# DOING BUSINESS IN FINLAND

Finland is a thriving economy. Although it is an established, 
well organized business environment, it also has its own 
practices and regulations that you need to be aware of. 
Establishing a business is made as easy as possible and 
practices and regulations aimed at fluent and predictable 
everyday operations.

# DOING BUSINESS IN FINLAND

Finland is one of the wealthiest countries and most stable societies in the world. Finland is at top of many international economic, technological, and social rankings.

Finnish government is business friendly, and the country has a well-developed infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and competitive operating costs. According to Transparency International, Finland is one of the least corrupted countries in the world – the red tape is minimal. As a member state of EU Finland adheres national legislation and EU directives.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 6]
Foreign-owned companies can benefit from government investment incentives and the latest research stemming from extensive cooperation between Finnish universities and the private sector. Companies also benefit from the clusters and centers of high-level expertise in various sectors that aim to maximize the benefits of research and international cooperation. As one of the most competitive and open economies in the world, Finland has a great deal to offer foreign investors.

# DOING BUSINESS IN FINLAND


## FINNISH BUSINESS CULTURE

Finnish customs and manners are Pan-European, but Finns also have a strong sense of national identity. English is a common business language. Most Finns working in business speak fluent English. According to Education First, Finns have the 3rd best English skills among adults around the world.

Communication style is polite, yet very straightforward and somewhat informal. A firm handshake is used to say hello and goodbye and eye contact is deemed important. Meetings tend to get straight down to business after greetings around. They are preferably short and to the point, and everyone is expected to join well-prepared. Appointments with Finnish associates should be set up in advance and contact information is readily available on company websites.

In Finland, all people are equal in the eyes of the law regardless of age, sex or occupation. Equality in Finnish working life is evident, for example, in the relatively high number of women holding advanced positions, but also in the way everyone calls each other by first name, regardless of position. Work has an important role and is highly valued in everyday life. Observing timetables and respecting agreements are important. A signature makes an agreement binding, so read all documents carefully before signing any contracts.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 7]

Legally, a verbal agreement is usually as binding as a written one. Official contracts are always drawn up for more significant agreements like rental, employment, co-operation etc. but smaller arrangements can be handled via email or by phone.

Many company processes are performed in Finland via electronic services (i.e., invoicing, newsletters, marketing, recruiting and customer service), and payments/ money transfers are usually handled via online bank services. Public authorities also offer electronic services that require electronic identification, requiring either the Suomi.fi-identification service or your bank's sign-in system.

## FAQ: DOING BUSINESS IN FINLAND

This section of the document (page 9) provides frequently asked questions about doing business in Finland. It addresses two key questions that are important for anyone looking to conduct business operations in the country.

### Question 1: Where can I find the official current exchange rate?

**Answer:** The official Central Bank of Finland

This answer indicates that the official current exchange rate can be found from the Central Bank of Finland. This is crucial information for businesses dealing with international transactions or currency conversions.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 9]
### Question 2: What are typical working hours in Finland?

**Answer:** Normal working hours usually do not exceed eight hours per day and forty hours a week. During a given week the number of working hours may be higher but the average workweek should not exceed forty hours. The maximum length of a working day or week is established by either legislation or binding collective labor agreements, often configured as an average for a period of two or three weeks.

This detailed answer provides important information about the work culture and labor regulations in Finland:

1. Standard working hours are 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.
2. There is some flexibility allowed in weekly hours, but the average should not exceed 40 hours.
3. Maximum working hours are regulated by law or collective agreements.
4. The calculation of working hours may be averaged over a period of two to three weeks.

This information is vital for businesses planning to operate in Finland, as it helps in understanding labor laws, planning workforce schedules, and ensuring compliance with local regulations.

# STARTING UP A BUSINESS IN FINLAND

In many ways Finland is a great place to establish or expand 
your business. In addition to providing a stable and safe 
environment, competent work force, efficiency, and high 
quality of the services, as well as a general progressive 
mindset – it's just a nice place to live and run a business.

# Starting Up a Business in Finland

This page provides an overview of starting a business in Finland, highlighting the country's welcoming attitude towards international companies and the ease of setting up a legal entity. The content is structured into a main title, a brief introductory paragraph, and a section detailing four quick steps to set up a business in Finland.

## Introduction

International companies are warmly welcomed and enjoy high return on investment in Finland. They can access the same benefits as Finnish companies. Opening a legal entity takes only a couple of weeks.

## 4 Quick Steps to Set Up a Business in Finland

The page presents four steps in a visually appealing format, with each step contained in a blue box for easy reading:

### Step 1:
Select a name for your company. To gain exclusive rights to the name, you should submit it to the Trade Register which is maintained by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH).

### Step 2:
Open a bank account for your business. The company requires a bank account to pay share capital, process payment transactions and support accounting.

### Step 3:
File a start of the business notification. Establishing and registering a business requires that a notification be filed with the Trade Register and various Tax Administration registers. This can be done easily using a single form ("Y form").

### Step 4:
Take advantage of online tools. You can establish a limited liability company online through the Business Information System online service. You can also create a workspace at My Enterprise Finland. The My Enterprise Finland service gives you access to a wealth of useful services. These online services require you to log in with your online banking credentials.

This layout provides a clear and concise guide for anyone looking to start a business in Finland, emphasizing the streamlined process and available online resources.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 13]
## SUBSIDIARY

A subsidiary is a separate entity controlled by its board of directors. Liability is limited to the share capital of the subsidiary. Shareholders in general are not liable for acts of the subsidiary company but directors may personally be liable. A subsidiary is regarded as a more substantial presence and is helpful, for example, in opening a bank account in Finland, obtaining a lease or other contracts, attracting personnel and entering into commercial agreements.

The procedure of registering a subsidiary in Finland is very simple and usually takes no longer than one week. First the subsidiary must check the availability of its name. Next, the articles of association, the list of shareholders, the nature of the contribution and a statement regarding the value of the contribution in kind, and details regarding their contribution must be deposited along with the decision to open.

When setting up a company, the founders register all the company's shares. There is no specified share capital required for private limited companies. Public limited companies must establish a share capital of at least €80 000.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 13]
The Finnish Companies Act does not specify anything about the residence or domicile of the shareholders, i.e., the founding shareholders of a limited company may also be from outside the EEA area.

The shareholders are liable for the company's commitments only to the extent of the capital that they have invested in the company unless they have guaranteed loans on its behalf. The shareholders have the power to make decisions on issues relating to a limited company. Shares equal votes, so the number of shares corresponds to the number of votes a shareholder has.

A limited company is required to have a board of directors appointed by the shareholders. The board is responsible for managing and representing the company. The board may elect a managing director to handle the day-to-day management of the company. However, the appointment of a managing director is optional. If a limited company has appointed a managing director, the appointment shall be indicated in the Memorandum of Association. If the board of a limited company is comprised of less than three members, at least one deputy member must be appointed.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 13]
## Limited company

All types of business can be set up as a limited company and one or more people or organizations can establish a limited company.

> **NOTE** that at least one of the board members and one of the deputy members (reviewed separately) must have permanent residence in the EEA area. If they do not, a license must be sought from the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) for all ordinary members or deputy members who are from outside the EEA area.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 13]
---

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 14]
## BRANCH

Foreign companies have the possibility of performing economic activities through branches in Finland. It is worth noting, that this form of business is not considered a legal entity and the parent company remains liable for its actions.

A branch of a foreign company is defined as a part of a foreign organization or foundation that runs a continuous business or trade from a permanent place of business in Finland in the name of and for the benefit of a foreign organization or foundation.

The branch must operate in the same line of business as the parent company. The name of the branch must include the name of the foreign trader in the registered form together with an addition that indicates it is a branch. The addition can be, for example, "sivuliike Suomessa" (branch in Finland), "filial in Finland" or "filial".

A Finnish branch must be registered at the Finnish Trade Register by either a representative of the parent company or an individual granted with power of attorney. Registration requires some specific documents such as the memorandum of association, the articles of association, a certificate of registration, and a standard application containing the following: the branch's name and its postal address, the type of performed business (same as the foreign company), the foreign company's name, company type, the name of the register where the foreign company was registered, and the name of the person entitled to represent the branch.

If the procedure is respected and all the documents are in good order, the registration process of the branch shouldn't take longer than seven working days.

> In branch, the parent company remains liable for its actions.

# COMPANY REGISTERS

The Finnish Trade Register is the official public register for information about enterprises. As a rule, all businesses must be enrolled in the register. Enrolment is achieved via a notification and is subject to charge. As the Trade Register, which is maintained by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH), has a joint notification procedure and information service with the Finnish Tax Administration, a business will only need to submit one notification to be enrolled in the trade, prepayment, employer, and VAT registers and there is no separate charge.

## Prepayment register

As a general rule, starting up business operations requires that the business is enrolled in the prepayment register maintained by the Finnish Tax Administration. You can enroll in the prepayment register using the same form that is used for notifying the Finnish Trade Register of your new business. For more information and details about the prepayment register, please view the chapter on taxation.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 15]
## Employer register

The employer register is maintained by the Finnish Tax Administration. A business must enroll in the employer register when it starts regular salary payments if it has:
1) at least two permanent employees during the calendar year or
2) at least six temporary employees at one time. If the payment of salaries and wages is temporary, or they are paid to only one employee, the business does not need to enroll in the employer register.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 15]
## VAT register

Businesses that are subject to value added tax (VAT) enroll in the Finnish Tax Administration's register via their declaration of foundation. At registration, they need to state the date of commencement of the operations that are subject to VAT. For more information and details about the VAT register, please view the chapter on taxation.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 15]
### CHARGE FOR REGISTRATION (2021)
€275

> You can enroll all mandatory company registers by a single form.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 16]

## Opening a Finnish Corporate Bank Account

A bank account can be opened for a registered company. In certain situations, an account is necessary even before the company is entered in the Trade Register. A bank account may be needed for example for the payment of share capital, clearing payment transactions, and to support accounting processes.

If the person opening a bank account for a company has the required documents when visiting the bank, the process typically runs smoothly. For companies/persons residing outside the EEA, it may take a little longer. We recommend booking an appointment for this purpose and preparing all the required documents in advance to speed up the process.

Information is required to optimize the account type and financing alternatives for the new customer company. The bank is obligated by law to know its customers, for which reason it may request separate documentation regarding the company's activities, financial position, services and the use and purpose of banking services. The law requires banks to ask for clarification about the origin and purpose of funds transferred to a customer's account.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 16]
All banks operating in Finland are listed on the website of the Financial Supervisory Authority.

The largest banks in Finland are:
- Nordea Bank Finland
- OP-Pohjola Financial Group
- Danske Bank Group

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 16]
As a rule, various bank groups adhere to similar practices and the following documents and measures are typically required when opening a corporate bank account. Requirements can vary from bank to bank, and we recommend you confirm the requirements of your potential bank before the initial meeting.

- An extract from the Finnish Trade Register (not older than 90 days).
- In the process of forming a limited company, the extract from the Trade Register is replaced by a formation package for limited companies, available at the website of the Business Information System www.ytj.fi. Alternatively, the extract from the Trade Register can be replaced by
  - a register certificate indicating that a declaration of establishment has been submitted
  - documents of incorporation (for example, for a limited company: memorandum of association, articles of association and the minutes of the constitutive meeting of shareholders)
- An extract from the minutes of the company's decision-making body (the Board of Directors), which indicates the names of those officials of the company authorized to use the account and their authorizations, the decision to open an account, and possible lending and submitting of collateral. A decision of the Board of Directors stating the account users is required, e.g. "It was decided to authorize the below-mentioned persons to use account no 123456- 12345: [names and personal identity numbers]."
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 16]

---
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 17]
## Opening a Finnish Corporate Bank Account (Contd.)

- An explanation of the nature and volume of payment transfers: an account of incoming and outgoing payments; size of individual payments
- A more specific and concrete explanation than the mission statement of the nature of the company's business activities, their extent, and the grounds for using banking services.
- Other company accounts
- An extract from the Articles of Association
- A list of shareholders including names, social security IDs or dates of birth, nationality if not Finnish, and the percentage of stocks and voting rights of each shareholder. If there are companies on the shareholders list, a full description of the group structure including company type, company ID number and country of registration.
- It is also necessary to identify the natural persons at the end of the ownership chain.
- For the beneficial owners, who directly or indirectly through other companies own more than 25% of the company, a notarized passport copy and a proof of residence (utility bills with home address or equivalent) in Latin alphabet is needed.
- If a person doesn't have a Finnish social security number, passport photocopies of bank account users and proof of residence is needed.
- Letter of recommendation from a Finnish company
- Certificate of the origin of the assets and foreign banking connections
- If the account opener is unknown, a letter of reference from another bank considered reliable by the bank opening the account (not all banks require this).

The required documents and information can be submitted either in Finnish, Swedish or English. The person who signs an agreement on behalf of a company, association or foundation must be registered in the trade register as a representative authorized to sign for it. Likewise, a person granted the right to use an account must be an authorized representative. S/he must also present an identity document or a passport. When opening bank accounts for a general or limited partnership, the signature of one general partner is enough, unless otherwise stated in the company rules.

> NOTE that it is essential to open a corporate bank account right at the beginning, as the share capital must be paid at the registration of a public limited company.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 17]

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 18]
# ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

One of the most important tasks for any company is managing the bookkeeping process. Accounting means recording the sums of money involved in business transactions resulting from business operations. Accounting collects complete financial documentation and registers information on business transactions, following a specific method. The result is financial statements on the company's finances. Accounting comprises the company's revenue, expenses, property, assets, and debts. Financial statements prepared based on accounting reveal the operating result. Company management is responsible for establishing and managing accounting.

## Finnish accounting act and financial statements

According to the Accounting Act, all enterprises and private persons engaged in business or professional activity are subject to an accounting obligation. The obligation commences from setting up a business. Accounting arrangements are therefore among the primary duties of a new company.

Companies in Finland often require the outside expert help for accounting tasks and outsourcing is very common. Companies have monthly, quarterly, and annual notification obligations to authorities. In addition, employer companies submit information on paid wages to their employment pension and accident insurance companies and apply for reimbursement for their occupational healthcare expenses.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 18]
## Audit

According to the Auditing Act a company must elect an auditor and carry out an audit of the accounts. Auditing forms a part of the business control system. It is therefore advantageous to take advantage of the services of a professional auditor to ensure that the financial statements and possible annual report provide correct, sufficient and consistent information. Auditors check the accounts of the company at least once a year.

According to the Auditing Act, a company need not appoint an auditor if certain conditions are met. Private entrepreneurs (i.e., those working under a business name) are not required to appoint an auditor. Small companies (limited companies, general partnerships, limited partnerships, cooperatives) are exempted from auditing. An auditor must be appointed if the company meets two of the following criteria:

- Balance sheet total exceeds 100 000 euros.
- Net sales or corresponding earnings exceed 200 000 euros.
- There are more than three employees on average.

The limits apply to both the concluded and the preceding accounting period. If the articles of association, partnership agreement or rules of the organization include a provision on appointing an auditor, an auditor must be appointed (or the relevant provision in the articles of association must be changed).

Auditors should be qualified and authorized. Auditors for large enterprises and companies listed on the stock exchange should possess additional qualifications. The Trade
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 18]

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 19]
# ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS (Contd.)

Register must be notified of the auditor. The Finnish Pat-
ent and Registration Office (PRH) oversees and approves
auditors.

A person who has passed the HT examination can special-
ize in audits of public interest entities (PIE) by passing
a KHT examination and/or in audits of public administra-
tion and finance by passing a JHT examination. The audi-
tor must be a KHT auditor or a firm if the corporation is
subject to public trading or if at least two of the following
conditions were met by the corporation or foundation in
the last completed fiscal year:

- The balance sheet total exceeds 25 000 000 euros
according to the financial statements of the previous
accounting

- Net sales or comparable revenue exceeds 50 000 000
euros according to the financial statements of the pre-
vious accounting period.

- The average number of employees exceeds 300 during
the accounting period.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 19]
## Outsourcing financial management

A company can manage its own accounting or outsource
financial management services from an expert accounting
firm. If there are a significant number of commercial op-
erations, it is advisable to use the services of a third-party
accounting bureau or hire an in-house certified accountant.

If a company decides to partially or completely outsource
financial management, it should select a professional, pref-
erably authorized accounting firm. Regardless, accounting
firms operate on the basis of professional responsibility:
they are responsible for ensuring that the work is done in
the manner agreed with the client based on the material
submitted by the client.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 19]
When choosing the right accounting services for a busi-
ness, matters to consider include:

- Which sectors of financial management the compa-
ny wishes to outsource and which the company will
manage on its own. (Invoicing, accounts payable and
receivable, payment transactions, payroll calculations,
business accounting, inventory management, budget,
cash flow and funds statements)

- Monthly business volumes

- What kind of cost center and budget monitoring is
required (product groups, departments) and what
requirements are set on reporting (accuracy of month-
ly reporting, for instance as regards financial state-
ments)

- Potential electronic solutions (including sales invoic-
es, purchase invoices, payment transactions, debt
collection)

- In many cases, small enterprises manage invoicing
and payment transactions themselves. On the other
hand, they frequently outsource accounts payable and
receivable, payroll calculations and debt collection as
well as accounting.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 19]
The following quality issues should be considered
when selecting an expert accounting firm:

The KLT accounting examination is the expert qualifica-
tion of professionals in the accounting sector. Candidates
are required to have a university level commercial degree
and several years' practical experience of diverse financial
management duties.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 19]
---

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 20]
The Association of Finnish Accounting Firms has almost 800 members. An accounting firm can be accepted as a member of the Association only if its management has passed the KLT accounting examination. Authorized accounting firms comply with the professional standards prepared for the industry by the Association of Finnish Accounting Firms aimed at minimizing risks to clients and ensuring a high-quality service relationship.

The largest bookkeeping companies in Finland by turnover:

- Accountor Group
- Rantalainen
- Talenom
- Administer
- Aallon Group

For a newly established company or entrepreneur without bookkeeping experience in Finland, an outsourced partner can help navigate financial legislation and ensure professional interaction with the tax department and other authorities.

The website of the Association of Finnish Accounting Firms offers a search service for finding local authorized accounting firms in a specific area. The site also provides a form for requesting a quotation and a template for a formal written agreement on assignments. You should always draw up a written agreement and comply with its terms and the agreed deadlines because any delays in submitting receipts can prove costly, either in the form of overtime compensation or penal interest paid to the Tax Administration.

# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

This section of the document discusses the importance of intellectual property rights when starting a business in Finland. It provides information on various forms of protection available for business ideas and inventions.

Safeguarding of key ideas can be done in accordance with legislation on intellectual property rights.

Options for protection include:
- A patent for a technical invention (valid for 20 years)
- A utility model (i.e., a four-year "small patent")
- A trademark (a symbol that distinguishes the goods and services of a company)
- A design right that protects the appearance of a product or a part of a product

Copyright protection is the only one that is not applied for separately. Non-disclosure agreements are one way to prevent a customer or collaborative partner from disclosing your unprotected business ideas.

When planning a business, the free-of-charge databases of the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH) offer an easy and quick way to check the industrial rights of other actors: trade names, trademarks, design rights, utility models and patents. The database can be used to check, among other things what has been protected, where and for how long.

In other words, are there any obstacles for the manufacture or marketing of your product or service or is your invention or solution unique and possibly patentable.

The document also includes a highlighted box with the following information:

> #1
> FINLAND IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
> International Property Rights Index 2021

This emphasizes Finland's strong position in protecting intellectual property rights on a global scale.

## Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)

The Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) is an agreement between patent authorities. Its aim is to provide applicants with a quick and efficient alternative to obtain a patent by filing a second application corresponding to a first application with any of the PPH-participating offices. The PRH (Finnish Patent and Registration Office) has made PPH agreements with several patent offices. The agreements also involve information exchange, resulting in less overlapping search and examination, and improved patent quality.

Applicants may request a fast-track examination of their application at a second office based on a Finnish patent application if PRH has already found their claims allowable. Reciprocally, if another office has found the patent claims allowable, applicants may request a fast-track examination from PRH.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 22]
## Forms of Intellectual Property Protection

The following table provides an overview of different forms of intellectual property protection, their usage, and validity periods:

| Form of Protection | Usage | Validity |
|-------------------|-------|----------|
| Patent | Protects a product, equipment or method | 20 years, in some cases 25 years |
| Utility model | Protects a product or equipment | 10 years (4+4+2) |
| Trademark | Distinguishability on the market | Perpetual, renewal at 10-year intervals |
| Design right | Protects the design of a product | 25 years (5+5+5+5+5) |
| Trade name | Protects the name of the business | Perpetual, if business is in operation |
| Copyright | Protects an intellectual work | Lifetime + 70 years |
| Trade secret | Protects information of economic significance | Until published |

## INDUSTRIES REQUIRING A BUSINESS LICENSE OR NOTIFICATION

Finland has freedom of trade, which means that you may engage in business operations that are lawful and in accordance with good practice without requiring a business license from the authorities. However, in certain industries, a business license is required to protect the community, the environment and consumer safety. In other fields, notifying the authorities is sufficient, and an official business license is not required.

Before commencing operations, it is always important to check whether a special business license or declaration is needed and what other requirements apply in your chosen field. Business licenses are granted by local authorities (municipalities and cities) and regional administration offices along with government departments, local environmental protection authorities and other licensing authorities.

A business license is generally granted for a fixed period, and it can be revoked if the person does not comply with the provisions of the license. Application for a business license is usually subject to a charge. In some cases, a business license is needed from many different authorities. For example, in the catering industry, hygiene certification and licenses to serve food and alcohol are required, and declarations must be made to the health inspector, the rescue services and local building supervision authorities, amongst other things.

> It's always important to check whether a license is needed in your operations.

# TAXATION

The tax system in Finland is among the most developed and efficient in the world. Fully digitized, most transactions can be managed online.

Finnish Tax Administration has unique business friendly, predictable approach and strongly focuses on modern pre-emptive approach instead of retrospective traditional tax audits. The Finnish Tax Administration has a dedicated team helping companies in tax matters, free of charge.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 30]

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 31]
# TAXATION

Finns are happy to pay tax to provide top-level public health care, free schooling and other valuable public services to all residents in the country.

Taxation is being harmonized within the European Economic Area. However, the individual states have extensive autonomy in taxation, and it has a central role in national economic policy.

Business taxation in Finland varies by company type. The profit of private businesspersons and self-employed persons is taxed as entrepreneur's income. The profit of a business partnership is taxed as income of the joint owners in accordance with the regulations on the taxation of joint owners of business partnerships. Corporations such as limited companies are taxpayers themselves, and they pay a corporation tax on their profit. A dividend paid by a corporation is taxed as income of the shareholders.

The amount of tax is calculated based on a company's profit and its net assets. Taxpayers are expected to make advance payments on their projected income, to be derived from the operation of a trade or business, agriculture, or other activity in order to generate income, including rental operations and receipts of capital gains. A company needs to be able to present receipts, invoices, and other reliable documents from all business operations.

Value-added tax must, almost without exception, be paid for the sale of goods and services through business operations in Finland. VAT taxpayers have reporting and payment obligations and are expected to submit periodic tax returns to report all VAT information for each taxable period.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 31]
---

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 32]

# TAXATION

The frequency of submitting periodic tax returns and making payments is dependent on the agreed length of reporting periods. The alternatives are monthly, quarterly, and yearly. To work out VAT payable, subtract the total input VAT on monthly purchases from the sum total of VAT that has been added to the prices of sold goods and services during the month.

Tax payments are made to bank account of the Tax Administration. Some tax payments are based on an official decision sent to the taxpayer (the exact amount and due date in the decision). Other payments are based on self-initiated, unprompted action. The taxpayer should calculate the exact amount and ensure payment by the correct due date.

Altogether, the taxation of a business consists of tax payments and declarations:

- Value added tax must be paid on sales.
- Taxes withheld at source and social security contributions must be paid from wages paid by companies.
- A company's income tax is determined as based on profit.

A company must disclose VAT and income taxation information to Tax Administration.

In addition, entrepreneurs must pay personal income tax from their wages and dividends.

Taxation varies by type of company and because of different circumstances. Please find more detailed information from your accountant or from the Finnish Taxation office.

> Tax payments are made to bank accounts of the Tax Administration.

The table compares corporate tax rates across 12 countries. Finland, the focus of this guide, has one of the lowest rates at 20.0%. The rates range from 20.0% (Finland) to 30.6% (Japan). Most European countries fall in the 20-26% range, with Germany being an exception at 30.0%. The United States sits in the middle at 21.0%. Asian countries represented (China and Japan) show a significant difference, with China at 25.0% and Japan at the highest rate of 30.6%.

This information is crucial for businesses considering international operations or comparing tax environments across different countries. It's important to note that corporate tax rates are just one aspect of a country's overall tax system and business environment.

# TAXATION

## VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)

VAT is a consumption tax that the seller of goods or services will add to the price. The seller thus collects this tax from customers to remit it to the state.

Liability to pay VAT concerns anyone who sells goods and services, rents out goods, or is engaged in similar commercial operations on an on-going basis. Goods are defined not only as tangible property, commodities, and goods but also electric power, gas, energy for heating, cooling and other similar purposes. The definition of services refers to everything else that can be supplied or sold in the course of business.

VAT is payable each time a sale of goods or services occurs. However, VAT is designed to be paid by the consumer. For this reason, the seller has the right to deduct the input VAT of his purchases of goods and services for business purposes, if another VAT taxpayer has supplied them to him.

In this way the VAT that is included in the actual consumer prices is only the VAT of the last seller in the supply chain.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 33]
If a company operates a business for which VAT is payable, requesting for VAT registration will be mandatory. However, no registration is required if turnover for the accounting period (12-month) remains below €10,000. The company with turnover below €10,000 can voluntarily be VAT registered if it operates its business commercially on an on-going basis. Additionally, some sectors have been left outside the scope of VAT taxation. These sectors are expressly listed in the legislature, and they include selling real estate and apartments or flats in housing companies, healthcare services, and social services.

If a business company only sells these goods or services, it will not be deemed liable to pay VAT.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 33]
### RATES OF VAT IN 2021

24%
General rate of VAT, effective for most goods and services

14%
Food, animal feed, restaurant services, meal catering services

10%
Books, medicine, services relating to physical exercise and sports, movies, entrance to cultural events and to entertainment events, transport of passengers, accommodation, and TV licenses.

To figure out the amount to add to the net price, the seller should multiply the tax base (= the net price without VAT) with the applicable rate. Tax base is the price payable by the buyer, in which no VAT is included.
[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 33]

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 34]

# INCOME TAXATION

The form of corporate entity of your company or organization will largely determine the company's income-tax obligations. Some entity forms, including limited companies and cooperative societies, are independently liable to pay income tax as taxpayers. Their receipts of income are taxed as income attributable to the entity itself. Corporate income tax rate is 20 %. If a limited company distributes dividend to its shareholders, the shareholder-beneficiaries will be taxed as provided by specific rules.

Profits are fully taxable as income of the owner shareholder in the case of a self-employed professional individual, a self-employed business entrepreneur or a general or limited partnership. The taxable income attributable to the operation of the trade or business is divided between a capital income portion and an earned income portion. Capital income is assessed at a 30-percent rate (> €30,000/34%). Earned income is assessed using a progressive scale.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 34]
## Entrepreneur's income tax

Earned income is considered to include wage income and the earned income portion of business income as well as pension and other taxable social benefits. In state and municipal taxation, taxable income is determined separately based on gross income and deductions therefrom. The taxes paid for each type of earned income are defined as based on taxable income and the tax rates and tax-like payments to which it is subject.

- If you receive a wage or salary income from other employers, they will declare your earnings to the Tax Administration.
- If your company pays you a wage, kilometer allowances or dividends, the company must pay taxes withheld at source based on your tax card.
- At the end of the year, the company must declare the paid wages to the Tax Administration in an annual return.
- The Tax Administration will send a pre-filled tax return including the information of the above-mentioned and other payers. Check the tax return and make changes, if necessary.

# PERMITS AND REGISTRATION

As a member of the European Union, any citizen of a member country can reside and work here without a special permit. And other nationals only need a passport or other required proof of identity to request a visa for a visit, a residence permit or work permit to start their career here.
---

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 37]
# PERMITS AND REGISTRATION

Those intending to work or employ themselves in Finland usually need a residence permit. A residence permit is generally required when a foreign national stays in Finland for longer than three months. EU-citizens and residents are not required residence or work permits in Finland. The same applies to citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Norway – they need to, however, register their residence with the proper authorities within three months of arrival.

A residence permit is also required for a stay lasting less than three months if a foreign national intends to work and a residence permit for an employed person is required for the work in question. For a residence permit or visa to be issued, the applicant must have a valid passport, or another travel document accepted by Finland.

The Finnish Immigration Service investigates whether the person meets the preconditions for residence in Finland. The permit application is submitted to a Finnish diplomatic mission abroad or to the Finnish Immigration Service, Migri.

# FAQ: PERMITS AND REGISTRATION

## How long does it take to obtain a Visa?

You should submit your visa application at a Finnish mission or a visa center no later than 15 days prior to travel. The application can be submitted at the earliest 90 days before the intended visit.

## Do I need a work residence permit if I already have another type of residence permit in Finland?

If you already have a residence permit in Finland based on some non-working grounds (i.e., family ties), it may imply the right to work. In this case, you will not need to obtain a working residence permit. Check your residence permit card and your residence permit decision to see whether you already have the right to work in Finland. If you have been granted a residence permit on the grounds of being a victim of human trafficking, you have the right to work in Finland without limitations.

## Do I need a work permit for a part-time job?

If you are a student and a Nordic or EU/EEA national, you do not need any special permits for working in Finland during your studies and in this case, there are no restrictions as to how many hours per week you are allowed to work. For non-EU residents, however, a work permit is necessary even for a part-time job. Non-EU students in Finland can work up to 25 hours per week part-time with their student residence permit during term times. During holidays, there is no limitation of working hours. You do not need a work permit if your part-time work stays within these limits but a student residence permit is obligatory in such instances.

## Do I have to apply for a work residence permit if I have a degree from Finland?

If you have completed a degree or qualification in Finland and you have a job, you must apply for a residence permit on the basis that you have a degree from Finland. If you have completed your degree in Finland, you can also receive a temporary residence permit for job application. This permit can only be granted as an extension to a student residence permit before it expires. This extension can be granted only once and for a maximum of 12 months.

# EMPLOYMENT

![Image of two people in winter clothing standing outside with buildings in the background]

Employment of staff requires careful planning and organizing. The process of finding the best suitable candidate can take time.

You can start recruitment by reporting a vacancy and scanning the listings of available employees in public employment and business services (www.te-service.fi). These services are free and commonly used in Finland.

Employment contracts in Finland are free of form but a written contract is always recommended. An employment contract can be fixed term or of indefinite duration. A fixed-term contract must always have justifiable grounds, such as substitution, seasonal work, or training, for example. An employer has the obligation to present written information on the principal terms of work in a contract, written or otherwise (primary duties, location of work, payment of wages, relevant dates, working hours, calculation of annual leave etc.).

An employment relationship in Finland must comply with the minimum terms set forth in legislation regarding employment (The Employment Contracts Act, The Working Hours Act and The Annual Holidays Act) as well as with collective agreements.

Before concluding an employment contract, find out if there is a generally applicable collective agreement concluded for the main business sector of your enterprise, the Finlex database is a good source.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 47]

This page contains information about employment in Finland, along with some key rankings highlighting Finland's global competitiveness.

The main text provides details on employment practices in Finland:

A minimum wage has not been determined in the legisla-
ture but there exists an expectation of reasonable remu-
neration for work considered normal in the sector (can
also be indicated in the generally applicable collective
agreement).

The most used payment systems are fixed monthly salary
and commission payment. During the first year of employ-
ment an employee will earn annual leave at the rate of 2
days/month; after the first year, the rate will increase to
2.5 days/month. A collective agreement may provide for a
holiday bonus.

If work is performed abroad for a minimum period of one
month, the information must include the duration of the
work, the currency in which the monetary pay is to be paid,
the monetary remunerations and fringe benefits applica-
ble abroad, as well as the terms for the repatriation of the
employee.

# LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF AN EMPLOYER

This section outlines the key legal obligations that employers in Finland must fulfill. The information is presented in two main parts: a list of general obligations and a breakdown of indirect staff costs.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 48]
## General Legal Obligations

- Pay wages during the sick leave of an employee (the collective agreement may obligate for the payment of wages also during a maternity leave and during a short-term absence to care for a sick child)
- Arrange preventive occupational healthcare for employees
- Take out employment pension insurance (TyEL)
- Take out group life insurance (in connection with the statutory workers' compensation insurance through a non-life insurance company)
- Pay unemployment insurance contributions, which are withheld from an employee's wages
- Insure employees against occupational injuries and occupational diseases

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 48]
## Indirect Staff Costs

In addition to wages, employers are responsible for the following indirect staff costs:

- Employees' pension insurance
- Employer's health insurance contribution
- Unemployment insurance contribution
- Accident insurance premiums
- Group life insurance premiums

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 48]
## Example Calculation of Labour Costs in 2021

This table provides a detailed breakdown of the total labour costs for an employer in Finland, based on a monthly wage of €3,000.

| Cost Item | Amount (€) |
|-----------|------------|
| Monthly wage for employee | 3,000.0 |
| Employer's health insurance contribution 1.53% | 45.9 |
| Small employer with insurance contract, pension contribution 25.3 % of which the employer's pension contribution (average) is 16.95 % | 508.5 |
| Occupational accidents, injuries and diseases insurances premium, on average 0.7 % | 21.0 |
| Employers unemployment insurance contribution 1.42 % | 42.6 |
| Group life insurance premium in the private sector, on average 0.06 % | 1.8 |
| **TOTAL** | **3,619.8** |

This calculation demonstrates that the total cost to the employer is significantly higher than the base salary due to various mandatory contributions and insurance premiums. The total labour cost for an employee with a €3,000 monthly wage amounts to €3,619.8, which is about 20.66% more than the base salary.

# HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES

This section of the document provides information on various methods and considerations for hiring new employees in Finland. The content is divided into several key points:

1. Staffing Enterprises:
   In some cases, it is easier to buy the necessary staff resources from another enterprise. A staffing enterprise pays the salary of the employee and handles all other employer obligations.

2. Apprenticeship Training:
   Apprenticeship training is another way of obtaining skilled employees trained specifically for a company's needs. Apprenticeship training is suitable for basic and advanced vocational education and training. An apprenticeship training agreement is a fixed-term employment contract.

3. Pay Subsidies:
   In some instances, an employer may be eligible for a pay subsidy when hiring an unemployed jobseeker whose employment may be hindered by reasons such as a prolonged period of unemployment, lack of professional skills, a disability, or an illness.

4. Public Employment Services:
   Public employment and business services can help you find employees and support you in recruitment issues.

5. Apprenticeship Training Guide:
   A guide to apprenticeship training can be found at Oppisopimus-website.

The document also includes a highlighted section on international talents:

## FIND INTERNATIONAL TALENTS TO ACCELERATE THE INTERNATIONAL GROWTH OF YOUR BUSINESS.

Business Finland provides funding and networks for hiring international talents.

This information is particularly relevant for businesses looking to expand their workforce and potentially tap into international talent pools. The document provides a comprehensive overview of different hiring strategies and support systems available in Finland for employers.

# EMPLOYMENT

## EURES

EURES is a European job mobility network that provides information, guidance, and recruitment/placement services to employers, jobseekers and any citizen wishing to take advantage of the freedom of movement for workers.

It covers the transparency of job vacancies, job applications and any related information for applicants and employers, and the development of services for the recruitment and placing of workers in employment and cross-border partnerships. The European Commission project (EURES) helps employers in recruiting young employees from another EU member country, Norway, or Iceland.

It aims to match hard to fill vacancies with motivated young candidates across Europe. Employers must pay a salary and social security or other benefits in accordance with the national labor laws. They must also provide a written work contract for a duration of at least six months. The employee must be aged 18 to 35 years.

Financial support may be granted to small and medium sized (SMEs) companies to cover some of the costs of induction training and integration to the new country. The amount of support granted to the employer is determined based on the type of integration program provided. The amount of support is about 872–1090 euros/employee and the support is tax-free.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 50]
### NOTE
that the same employment terms and occupational safety requirements apply both to foreign and Finnish employees. As an employer, you must also ensure that your employees receive sufficient induction training for their work tasks.

Also note that there are certain professions that must receive permission to practice their profession in Finland. For example, in the healthcare sector, a decision of recognition by the National Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira) is mandatory.

When your employee arrives, help him or her with practical arrangements and remind him or her that s/he should register with the Local Register Office, open a bank account, and acquire a tax card. Your responsibilities include arranging insurance policies, social security payments and occupational healthcare.

# FAQ: EMPLOYMENT

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 51]
## What is the duration of annual leave?

Based on legislation (the Employment Contracts Act, the Working Hours Act and the Annual Holidays Act), during the first year of employment an employee will earn annual leave at the rate of 2 days/month; after the first year the rate will increase to 2.5 days/month. It is worth noting, that collective agreements may also have additional terms, which may provide for a holiday bonus. A regular salary is paid to employees during annual leave.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 51]
## What are the terms of maternity leave in Finland?

Maternity leave can begin 50-30 working days before the expected due date. Maternity allowance is paid for 105 working days during maternity leave. Parental leave begins after maternity leave. During parental leave, Kela pays a parental allowance for 158 working days. Either the mother or the father can take a parental leave, or the parents can divide it between them. For more information, please visit www.kela.fi.

[Doing Business in Finland Guide, Page 51]
## What is the duration and conditions for sick leave?

According to labor legislation, an employee who is unable to work due to an illness or accident has the right to take paid sick leave. The employer is responsible for continuing to pay a full salary during the first 10 days of an employee's sick leave. After that if the employee is covered by Finnish social security Kela pays sickness allowance to compensate for loss of earnings.

An employment contract may also list other conditions and the employee may continue receiving a full salary for a longer period. An employer has the right to ask an employee to provide a doctor's certificate confirming the illness.

An employee should notify his or her supervisor of the need for sick leave immediately. The supervisor will let the employee know whether a doctor's certificate is required immediately or only on the fourth day of sick leave.

Remember, that occupational health services must be made available to all employees. Besides occupational health services, employers may also provide their employees with access to medical services.

# A COMPANY'S LOCATION AND BUSINESS PREMISES

Finnish infrastructure is modern and well-maintained, and the rental property market is active. Technological capability is high and covers practically every corner of the country. Transportation between locations is rapid due to a relatively high level of public transportation and great coverage of the nation by air and rail.
[Business Finland Guide, Page 53]

[Business Finland Guide, Page 54]
# A COMPANY'S LOCATION AND BUSINESS PREMISES

Foreign companies can lease or acquire business premises in Finland.

You can either lease or purchase premises for your business or build a new facility on a site. Before deciding between leasing, buying, or building business premises, you should find out where the ideal location for your line of business is and clarify your essential needs. For example, should the premises be in an industrial area or in a more central location? How much space is needed? Is adequate storage space available? Is there room to expand? How are the logistics to be handled?

A comparison between leasing and purchasing premises is very sensible. Owning premises ties up company capital, detracting it from the actual business and core competencies, but it may also be a sound investment. Leasing premises can improve the ability to react quickly to changes in the company's need for space. On the other hand, owning the premises will ensure the undisturbed continuance of business. Additionally, the rental costs of business premises can be very high in certain areas.

# A COMPANY'S LOCATION AND BUSINESS PREMISES

This page provides detailed information about real estate ownership, leasing, and considerations for business premises in Finland. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. Real Estate Ownership:
   - When purchasing real estate or a housing unit in Finland, the buyer becomes the owner.
   - Ownership rights are protected by the constitution.
   - Property can only be taken away following specific legal procedures, typically with full compensation if redeemed by the state or municipality.

2. Leasing:
   - Leasing is a fixed-term arrangement, not a permanent solution.
   - Leases of real properties are covered by legal protection.
   - Rights and obligations are prescribed by law.
   - Lease agreements are binding on contracting parties and may also be binding on third parties.
   - The right to lease land remains binding even if the property is sold to a new owner.
   - Lease agreements on housing units are binding on new owners until they terminate the agreement.

3. Considerations for Business Premises:
   - Before finalizing rental agreements or sales contracts, it's crucial to:
     a) Determine the suitability of the premises for your business.
     b) Check for any required permits (e.g., building or environmental permits).
   - Depending on the business type, additional arrangements or modifications may be necessary (e.g., air conditioning solutions).
   - For new property construction, contact the local Building Control Department for guidance before signing agreements.

4. Additional Resources:
   The document provides links for more information on vacant premises and business environments:
   - Local Regional Business Development
   - Real estate for business

This information is crucial for businesses looking to establish or relocate their operations in Finland, covering both ownership and leasing options, as well as important considerations for selecting appropriate business premises.

## Organising the Infrastructure for Premises and for Industrial Operations

In Finland electricity and water connections are quite easy to obtain. There are ready-to-use interfaces and connections for electricity and water in business premises and in new building lots. You can tender out your consumable electricity with different providers but note that you still need to pay for local electricity company transmission fees. Water is a part of municipal services and therefore consumption prices can vary remarkably in different areas.

The Finnish Energy Authority promotes and monitors the energy market and advocates the reduction of emissions, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. Operating under the administrative sector of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, the Energy Authority verifies the functionality of the converging electricity and gas markets and monitors network service pricing.

[Business Finland Guide, Page 56]
### Case example:

When choosing premises for your business, it is important to follow industry-specific requirements and guidelines. For example, in the case of a café or restaurant business it is important to choose premises that are deemed suitable for café or restaurant use by building inspection.

For a café or a restaurant, the ventilation and air conditioning systems need to be efficient enough to accommodate people inside the premises. Modifying an existing ventilation system or building a new one can be quite costly (more than €15,000) if the premises have not been used for operating a café or restaurant before.

In such a case, it would be more cost effective to find a place where such systems already exist. The same goes for the electricity connection as installation work is quite expensive in Finland and can only be undertaken by certified specialists. A sufficient pre-existing electricity system might save you as much as €10,000 in installation costs.

A café or restaurant is also required to provide enough restrooms for customers: one restroom for every 25 customers.
